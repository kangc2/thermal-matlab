Github is where we can change and edit the same code files individually while having all of our files tracked and saved online. The purpose is to organize our code and to be able to easily manage the code files without running into problems in the future.

## Repository
The repository is the location of all our of files, images, folders, etc. It also shows all of the changes and updates made to each file. Right now- 'thermal-matlab' is our repository name and where all the documentation and files are in. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs.

The README.md file is to give information of our project and code files. 

## Branches 
The main purpose is to avoid saving different verisons of the same file. Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.
Something like this can be easily avoided by using branches:

story.txt

story-joe-edit.txt

story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt

Github uses branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our main (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into the 'main' branch.
Everyone starts off working in the main branch, also refered to as main, which is where all the code is editted and where the final result is made.
When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while youwere working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

To create a branch:
1. Click the code tab in repository
2. Click the drop down menu at the top of file that says main
3. Type in a branch name into text box
4. Click create branch


## Cloning the Repository
This means to copy the repository onto your computer locally so you can make changes into the file without having to
