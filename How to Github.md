Github is where we can change and edit the same code files individually while having all of our files tracked and saved online. The purpose is to organize our code and to be able to easily manage the code files without running into problems in the future. Github is a place that stores and organizes our project onto the cloud, so anyone with internet can access it any time. This also means that any changes we want to make requires internet.

To actually use Github as a team collaboration and make changes to our code as a team, we need to download the Github app onto the desktop or get a Git software (like Gitbash) 

## Repository
The repository is the location of all our of files, images, folders, etc. It also shows all of the changes and updates made to each file. Right now- 'thermal-matlab' is our repository name and where all the documentation and files are in. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs.

The README.md file is to give information of our project and code files. 

To create a repository:
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select New repository
2. In the Repository name box, enter a name.
3. In the Description box, write a short description.
4. Select Add a README file.
5. Click Create repository.


## Branches 
The main purpose is to avoid saving different verisons of the same file. Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.
Something like this can be easily avoided by using branches:

story.txt

story-joe-edit.txt

story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt

Github uses branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our main (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into the 'main' branch.
Everyone starts off working in the main branh which is where all edits are officially published.
When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while youwere working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

To create a branch:
1. Click the code tab in repository
2. Click the drop down menu at the top of file that says main
3. Type in a branch name into text box
4. Click create branch

## Making and Committing Changes
In a new branch (where it is just you making edits thats not affecting what is already published or being editted at the same time) you can make changes to the files in your repository. Every time you edit and want to make a final change to the file, Github is set up that after you finish editting, you can write a commit message, describing everything you changed and why. They help capture the history of the what changes and who changed what and why it was changed.

To commit a change in the GitHub Desktop:
1. Open the file and click edit (pencil icon)
2. Edit file
3. At the bottom of page, there is a commit changes box to add comments
4. Click commit changes
5.

This means to copy the repository onto your computer locally so you can make changes, edits, add and remove files, and push larger commits. 
When you clone the repository, you download the full copy of the repository at that point in time. If other people made and committed changes, you can add those changes to your copy of the repository. 

This requires each person to have Git,
